  <h1>Brittany Bisbee-Green</h1>
  <p>Hello, my name is Brittany Bisbee-Green. I’ve been working at the IT Services Assistance Center at The University of Arkansas at Little Rock for a year. We are the first level of services for customers with Technical issues. 

    I’m currently working on my Post-Baccalaureate degree in Web Design and Development
    
    My current goal, after graduation, is to attend Capital One’s Design Development Program in Richmond, Virginia. I want to use this program to enhance my skills in the UX/UI design/Research field.
