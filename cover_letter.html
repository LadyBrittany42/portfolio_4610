    <p>Dear Tori Compton,</p>
    
    <p>I was thrilled that you reached out to me for the Design Development Program Associate position. 
    I believe that I would make a good candidate for the position because I am deeply interested in the UX research field, as well as all facets of the UX/UI design.</p>
    
    <p>Some of the qualifications that I bring to the table are experience in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. 
    I have used these programs to manipulate images and graphics inside of a classroom environment as well as outside. 
    I also have experience being a contributing member of a team both inside a classroom environment and within my position as a Computer Support Specialist.</p>
    
    <p>I wanted to thank you for reaching out to me on the Design Development Program Associate position. 
    It sounds like an incredible opportunity and I would love to be a part of it. If you have any questions for me, 
    feel free to reach me at the number or email address listed above. I will be following up with you through the email address that you provided.</p>
    
    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
    
  <p>Brittany Bisbee-Green</p>
