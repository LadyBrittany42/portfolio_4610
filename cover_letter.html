    <p>Dear Tori Compton,</p>
    
    <p>I was thrilled that you reached out to me for the Design Development Program Associate position.<br> 
    I believe that I would make a good candidate for the position because I am deeply interested in the <br>
    UX research field, as well as all facets of the UX/UI design.</p>
    
    <p>Some of the qualifications that I bring to the table are experience in Adobe Photoshop and <br>
      Illustrator. I have used these programs to manipulate images and graphics inside of a classroom <br>
      environment as well as outside. I also have experience being a contributing member of a team both <br>
      inside a classroom environment and within my position as a Computer Support Specialist.</p>
    
    <p>I wanted to thank you for reaching out to me on the Design Development Program Associate position.<br> 
    It sounds like an incredible opportunity and I would love to be a part of it. If you have any questions <br>
    for me, feel free to reach me at the number or email address listed above. I will be following up with <br>
    you through the email address that you provided.</p>
    
    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
    
  <p>Brittany Bisbee-Green</p>
